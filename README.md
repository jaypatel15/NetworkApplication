📋 Assignment Requirements
This project satisfies all requirements of SENG2040 Assignment 1 as specified:

✅ Technical Requirements
- Developed in C or C++ on Windows

- Used provided reliable UDP code without removal or refactor of core functionality

- Successfully sends and receives both ASCII and binary files

- Implements file transfer using custom packet-based protocol

- Implements whole file error detection (e.g., MD5 or CRC32)

- Tests ensure complete file integrity

- Transmission time is measured with fractional-second precision

- Transfer speed is calculated and displayed in Megabits per second (Mbps)

- No string functions used for binary file handling

- No hardcoded IP address or port – command line input used

- Successfully tested across physically separate machines via ZeroTier VPN

- Multiple file sizes and types tested: small, medium, large (ASCII & binary)

✅ Documentation and Submission
- Report submitted in PDF format including:

- Error detection implementation & reference

- Protocol description with chart

- Transfer speed results

- Work breakdown

- Source code submitted as a single ZIP file (cleaned)

- Git project submitted as a .bundle file

- File names follow required naming convention: user1_user2.pdf, etc.

✅Evaluation Areas Addressed

✔️ Report Completeness and Accuracy

✔️ Demonstration-Ready Code

✔️ Full Implementation of All Requirements
